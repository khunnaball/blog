2021 has been a wild year, music is often one of the best things to get you through stressful times.
I've always wanted to break down what I've listened to throught the year, so let's do just that!

I'll just do my top 5 for now..

## glaive

No surpise to anyone who's heard of Hyperpop, since its massive blow up this year on tiktok. 
There really is no one that does it better than glaive, I've listened to a lot of his stuff this year and there is honestly no surprise he was my #1, I listend to him on repeat for weeks!

6 of his songs were in my top 10 most listened to songs, which again is no surpise. I go through a lot of phases in music but always come back to the same genres, but Hyperpop certainly was not a genre I thought I would get into. Not only for the fact that I had never heard of it until about 6 months ago..

Recommendations: astrid, detest me, eyesore.

## Gender Roles

Gender roles are a band that my friend showed me early in the year and I could not get enough of them, I think I showed them to literally anyone that would listen, I'm sure they got sick of hearing about them..

They have a really unique and fun sound that is a nice change from a lot of the stuff I usually listen to, they really are a band you just have to give them a listen to understand what I mean.

Recommendations: Ickie, Always, Bubble.

## Gleemer

Gleemer are a band that are described as a "alternative noise pop quartet" which I think sums them up pretty well honestly, their noisey dissonant sounds blended perfectly with a shoegazey sound works perfectly and will keep you listening for hours in awe. 
Again, Gleemer are just a band you need try to understand how impactful their sound can be, their latest album is a testament to that.

Recommendations: Gauze, Come Down and Shoulder Pads.

## Movements

Movements are a band that I'm sure you will have heard of if you are in the emo/pop punk scene and for good reason. They are truly a stape of the genre now and their songs about anxiety/depression really ring through and through with a lot of their fans.
You can see the influence from bands like Title Fight, Balance & Composure (two of my all time favourite bands) and it works so well for them. They truly are an impressive band and one you should for sure check out if you haven't already.

Recommendations: Daylily, Seneca, Deadly Dull

## Casey

Casey really are an emotional melodic hardcore band through and through, their songs about relationships, mental health and the struggles that come with those are really a deep dive into their psyche.

They have some really heavy hitting songs that hit you everytime, but as my girlfriend says "Why do they need to scream?", it conveys a certain sense of emotion you can't just get from singing, especially when the lyrics are a gut wrenching as Caseys.

Recommendations: Bruise, Fluorescents, Hell
