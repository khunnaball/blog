2021 has been a wild year, music is often one of the best things to get you through stressful times.
I've always wanted to break down what I've listened to throught the year, so let's do just that!

I'll just do my top 5 for now..

## glaive

No surpise to anyone who's heard of Hyperpop, since its massive blow up this year on tiktok. 
There really is no one that does it better than glaive, I've listened to a lot of his stuff this year and there is honestly no surprise he was my #1, I listend to him on repeat for weeks!

6 of his songs were in my top 10 most listened to songs, which again is no surpise. I go through a lot of phases in music but always come back to the same genres, but Hyperpop certainly was not a genre I thought I would get into. Not only for the fact that I had never heard of it until about 6 months ago..

## Gender Roles

Gender roles are a band that my friend showed me early in the year and I could not get enough of them, I think I showed them to literally anyone that would listen and I do not regret a thing.

## Gleemer
